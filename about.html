    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Sarra Mechrgui, a passionate front-end developer from Tunisia. I love building beautiful and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    
    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Become a professional front-end developer</li>
      <li>Find an internship or work abroad</li>
      <li>Improve my English communication skills</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I love</h2>
    <p>I enjoy kickboxing, fitness, traveling, and learning new things every day!</p>

    <h2>Why I'm a Great Fit for Your Internship</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a self-motivated front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I’m actively learning React and Node.js to build dynamic and full-stack web applications. My goal is to become job-ready within 6 months by working on real projects and improving both technical and communication skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning, I’m highly organized, and I’m not afraid to ask questions or try new things. I’m especially looking for an internship where I can grow in a supportive environment while contributing value from day one.
